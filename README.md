# BloodBankManagement--Sprint2
Blood Bank Management -- This is Sprint-2 of Spring Boot-based web application Project.
You can find the Angular frontend work of BloodBankManagement here: [Github Link](https://github.com/Arya200129/BloodBankManagement--Sprint2--FrontEnd)

It works on Apache Tomcat, Spring Boot devtools, Spring Boot Web, Lombok, MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver for MySQL), Javaâ„¢ Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB), Spring Data JPA and many such spring-boot starter tools.

The sprint 1 was only for client-side but now I have updated it to be both client-side and server-side(admin-side). We can run it using Postman application.

In addition to that I have also created the front-end design of it using Angular Ts. It works on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Typescript.  

This project is created under the guidance of Anudip Foundation as a part of Java Full Stack course.
